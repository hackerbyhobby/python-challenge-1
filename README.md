# python-challenge-1
> Module 2 Challenge for ASU AI Bootcamp

I worked on my homework with Ray Georges (a classmate). I spent the majority of time helping him, while also writing my code.

We designed an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills we've learned in Python so far

## Installing / Getting started

type away!

```shell
python-challenge-1
```

Just follow the menu items and it'll print your orders and the order total!
